**The Khan Academy**, located in Mountain View, CA, is biased against remote developers, but is open to it if the
candidate is right. For example, they would be willing to hire someone right out of college with lots of
talent but without having lots of experience. But they would not hire the same candidate to a remote position.
All Khan Academy interviewees must pass the "clearly demonstrated ability to be very driven, and ship repeatedly"
test, but remote employees are required to completely ace this test. In essence, remote people must have been close
to one of them in some way.
