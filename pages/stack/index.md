**<a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring">Stack Exchange</a>**,
located in New York, NY, has over 60 employees. Founder *emeritus* Jeff Atwood's
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/05/on-working-remotely.html">first four employees</a>
were found all over the United States. Jeff believes that the minimum remote team size is two: one
cannot work in isolation. Additionally, Stack Exchange only considers "grizzly veterans" for remote
positions; mentoring doesn't work remotely.
